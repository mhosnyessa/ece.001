        You may have a stereotype image or more about programers or programing overall.
        one of these or maybe all of them are of your thouphts about that dark world: -

          <h3 class="container">top myths about programing</h3>
          <li>
            <p>
            Myth 1. Programming locks you into a life of servitude to your computer<br/><sub>One of the most widespread myths about programming is that you have to spend your life in front of a computer if you decide to break into the field. This myth is probably perpetuated by Hollywood movies that show hackers writing code and sipping energy drinks at 3 o'clock in the morning.In reality, programming is one of the most in-demand job fields in the universe, and this often rewards coders with a relatively amazing amount of leverage and freedom of choice.
            Sure, you might spend your working hours writing code in an ordinary office setting. But in many cases, programmers can also earn well over six figures in salary, take extensive amounts of travel, enjoy company-sponsored trips, and even work remotely. There aren’t many other career paths that offer the amount of freedom that programming provides.</sub>

            <p>
            Myth 2. Programming is for nerds<br/><sub>Many people subconsciously stereotype programmers in all sorts of ways. People naturally assume that programmers are geeks, loners, or robotic types who just want to hang out in a room and pump out code for 12+ hours every day.

            And, while most good programmers do enjoy the process of geeking out and building awesome products, times are also changing.

            People from all backgrounds and walks of life are starting to code. There are young, mature, introverted and extroverted programmers who all write excellent code. In fact, one of the best parts of programming is that anyone can learn how to code in a traditional academic setting, or even from the convenience of your own home.</sub>

            Myth 3. Basic programming is hard<br/><sub>Declaring the difficulty of programming is always a controversial topic. Especially since everyone approaches programming with unique life experiences, perspectives and skill sets.

            But in general, learning how to write basic code isn’t too difficult. It’s just a skill that requires time and grit, like any other pursuit that’s worth achieving.

            To be fair, most programmers do have to confront the mental pain that comes with writing apps and solving problems on a day-to-day basis. This can absolutely be stressful, and downright mentally exhausting at times.

            But, when compared to the physical exhaustion of a career like working in a coal mine, or chopping trees as a lumberjack, writing code might even be seen as luxurious at times.</sub>

            <p>
            Myth 4. Programmers can automatically solve technology problems<br/><sub>While it’s true that most programmers are technically savvy, the general public seems to think that programmers can also repair hardware, provide IT support, and solve most problems related to technology.

            But in reality, programmers are simply people who specialize in building and maintaining digital products like software, apps, games and websites. So, there are some programmers who might be experts at creating iOS apps, but not have any experience with setting up a basic web server - or even configuring an internet router for that matter.

            Next time someone asks you for IT support, kindly explain that you specialize in writing code, not tech repair work!</sub>

            <p>
            Myth 5. Programming is boring<br/><sub>For most programmers, writing code is about finding solutions to everyday problems. And once programmers are able to solve the problems related to their domain, an extremely gratifying feeling of satisfaction usually takes over.

            So, programming comes with all of the normal ups, downs, setbacks and wins that most job fields offer. This means that programming is anything but boring. It’s much more of a rollercoaster than most people expect.</sub>
